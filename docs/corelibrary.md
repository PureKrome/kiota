# Core Library

The _Core_ library is intended to be used by request builders to make HTTP requests. The core library is responsible for aspects of making the HTTP request, managing connections and receiving the HTTP response. The core library can be either completely API agnostic, or can have capabilities that are specific to the API being called.  This is a good place to handle cross cutting concerns for the entire API.

In order to support different implementations of the core library, the service library generated by Kiota talks to the core library via a set of abstractions defined in the [Kiota Abstractions](kiotaabstractions) library.
